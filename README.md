# Recipe converter

Convert recipes into the [recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe) format that
[tandoor](https://docs.tandoor.dev/) and other recipe managers can use. We do
this from a custom markdown format, which is easy for me to get recipes into,
and thus have more success than relying on automatic recipe scrapers, and on a
wider variety of websites.

Also includes a script to convert some recipes I have from an old Trello board
(exported as a large json) into this custom markdown format.
